# gitscene project d3js

D3Js code for visualizing [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Goal

The goal is to use the data generated from a Github Account to paint a clear as to what's going on

## Why

I'm starting this repo because my most favorited repo uses D3Js for visualizing Github data, so I'm going to expand on that and make more data views of Github data

## Usage

```
npm install http-server -g
cd <chart-dir>
http-server
```
